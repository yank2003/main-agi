            Like many major companies, AGI-Growth-X's name, logo, and the
            identities of its people may from time to time be used as part of
            scams or fraudulent schemes. These instances are rare but deeply
            concerning.

          <p className="mt-8">
            Please be cautious when communicating with anyone claiming to
            represent AGI-Growth-X who is soliciting money or offering
            investment opportunities. AGI-Growth-X is not an investment company.
            Any such communications are fraudulent and should be disregarded.

            We are also aware of scams involving false employment offers that
            use fake websites, messages, and other deceptive means. These are
            not legitimate offers. AGI-Growth-X does not conduct interviews
            through instant messaging platforms and never asks candidates to
            purchase products, process payments, or share financial information.

            recommend not engaging with it and reporting any suspicious activity
            to your local authorities.
